Welcome to Sunset Ninjas!

You use Arrow up, arrow right, arrow down and arrow left to navigate the user interface. Space or enter toggles whichever button you are on.

To start the game, select “New Game”. It will lead you to a player selection screen, in which there are four buttons. The first one is always assigned for player one. 
You can have up to four players, and they can be either player controlled or computer controlled.
In order to add a player or change who is controlling it, press space to toggle the button.

When you are satisfied with the number of players, toggle “Next”.

The next screen is character selection menu. Every player will have to choose which character they would like to play. Computer controlled players will have a character randomly assigned to them from the remaining ones.
